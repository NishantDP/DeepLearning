# Deep Learning
# Basic implementation of some of the deep learning techniques in Python
## All the projects are from Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree Program.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### 1.Gradient Descent

In this section, the following basic functions are implemented:

- Sigmoid activation function
- Output (prediction) formula
- Error function
- The function that updates the weights


### 2. NN training steps:

- One-hot encoding the data
- Scaling the data
- Writing the backpropagation step
- Training the 2-layer Neural Network
- Back-propagate the error
- Training the above NN using MSE as error function
- Implementing a hidden layer and back propogation in the above NN with MSE.


### 3. Deep learning with TensorFlow
- Introduction to TensorFlow, tensors, single and multi-layer NN.
- NN with TensorFlow and Keras
	- Creating pipelines
	- Implementing softmax
	- Building NN model
	- Making predictions
	- Other ways of building model- subclassing, adding layers.
